### Implementation Plan: Neighborhood Dynamic Route

#### Step 1: Create Dynamic Route Structure

**Create:** `src/app/(frontend)/areas-we-serve/[slug]/page.tsx`

```
src/app/(frontend)/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ areas-we-serve/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx           ‚Üê Main "Areas We Serve" page
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [slug]/
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx       ‚Üê Individual neighborhood pages
```

#### Step 2: Neighborhood Page Template

The dynamic page will:

1. **Fetch neighborhood data** from Neighborhoods collection by slug
2. **Render uniform template** with 8 sections:

```tsx
// Section breakdown per CLAUDE.md (lines 1844-1891)

<NeighborhoodPage>
  <Hero
    heading="[Neighborhood] Property Management"
    subheading="Expert property management services in [Neighborhood], Georgia"
    backgroundImage={neighborhood.featuredImage}
  />

  <Section1_About>
    {neighborhood.description} // RichText from collection
    - Brief history
    - Why it's a great rental market
    - Resident demographics
    - Notable features
  </Section1_About>

  <Section2_RentalMarketData>
    <IconGrid columns="four">
      <Card>1BR: ${neighborhood.marketData.averageRent1BR}/mo</Card>
      <Card>2BR: ${neighborhood.marketData.averageRent2BR}/mo</Card>
      <Card>3BR: ${neighborhood.marketData.averageRent3BR}/mo</Card>
      <Card>4BR+: ${neighborhood.marketData.averageRent4BR}/mo</Card>
    </IconGrid>

      - Avg Days on Market: {neighborhood.marketData.averageDaysOnMarket}
      - Properties We Manage: {neighborhood.marketData.propertiesManaged}
    </Statistics>
  </Section2_RentalMarketData>

  <Section3_Schools>
    {neighborhood.topSchools.map(school => (
      <SchoolCard
        name={school.schoolName}
        type={school.schoolType}
        rating={school.rating}
      />
    ))}
  </Section3_Schools>

  <Section4_LocalAttractions>
    <IconGrid columns="three">
      Parks: {filter attractions by 'park'}
      Shopping: {filter attractions by 'shopping'}
      Dining: {filter attractions by 'dining'}
      Entertainment: {filter attractions by 'entertainment'}
    </IconGrid>

    <CommuteTimesWidget>
      To Midtown: {neighborhood.commuteTimes.commuteToMidtown}
      To Downtown: {neighborhood.commuteTimes.commuteToDowntown}
      To Airport: {neighborhood.commuteTimes.commuteToAirport}
      To Perimeter: {neighborhood.commuteTimes.commuteToPerimeterMall}
    </CommuteTimesWidget>

    MARTA Access: {neighborhood.martaAccess}
  </Section4_LocalAttractions>

  <Section5_PropertyTypes>
    - Single-family homes
    - Condos/townhomes
    - Multi-family (if applicable)
  </Section5_PropertyTypes>

  <Section6_OurExperience>
    - Number of properties managed: {neighborhood.marketData.propertiesManaged}
    - Years operating here
    - Success stories
    - Local partnerships
  </Section6_OurExperience>

  <Section7_AvailableProperties>
    // Query Properties collection where:
    // properties.neighborhood === neighborhood.id
    // properties.status === 'available'

    <PropertyGrid>
      {availableProperties.map(property => <PropertyCard />)}
    </PropertyGrid>
  </Section7_AvailableProperties>

  <Section8_CTA>
    <HeroCTA
      headline="Ready to Maximize Your {neighborhood.name} Property?"
      ctaText="Get Free Rental Analysis"
      ctaUrl="/contact"
    />
  </Section8_CTA>
</NeighborhoodPage>
```

#### Step 3: Main "Areas We Serve" Page

**Create:** `src/app/(frontend)/areas-we-serve/page.tsx`

Per CLAUDE.md lines 1765-1839:

```tsx
<AreasWeServePage>
  <Hero
    heading="Property Management Across Metro Atlanta"
    subheading="Local expertise in [X] neighborhoods and communities"
  />

  <InteractiveMapSection>
    // Google Maps embed with custom markers
    // Or photo grid of neighborhoods
  </InteractiveMapSection>

  <ServiceAreaGrid>
    // Group neighborhoods by region

    <RegionSection region="North Atlanta">
      {neighborhoods
        .filter(n => n.region === 'north')
        .map(n => <Link href={`/areas-we-serve/${n.slug}`}>{n.name}</Link>)
      }
    </RegionSection>

    <RegionSection region="South Atlanta">
      {neighborhoods.filter(n => n.region === 'south')}
    </RegionSection>

    <RegionSection region="East Atlanta">
      {neighborhoods.filter(n => n.region === 'east')}
    </RegionSection>

    <RegionSection region="West Atlanta">
      {neighborhoods.filter(n => n.region === 'west')}
    </RegionSection>

    <RegionSection region="Central/Midtown">
      {neighborhoods.filter(n => n.region === 'central')}
    </RegionSection>

    <RegionSection region="Perimeter">
      {neighborhoods.filter(n => n.region === 'perimeter')}
    </RegionSection>
  </ServiceAreaGrid>

  <CTA />
</AreasWeServePage>
```

#### Step 4: SEO Optimization

Each neighborhood page gets:
- **Title:** "[Neighborhood] Property Management | Allay Property Management"
- **Meta Description:** `neighborhood.metaDescription` (from collection)
- **H1:** "[Neighborhood] Property Management"
- **URL:** `/areas-we-serve/[slug]`
- **Schema Markup:** LocalBusiness + Service
- **Word Count:** 800-1200 words
- **Keywords:** "[Neighborhood] property management", "property manager in [Neighborhood]"

#### Step 5: Reusable Components Needed

Create these components for neighborhood pages:

```
src/components/neighborhoods/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NeighborhoodHero.tsx           // Hero with background image
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RentalMarketStats.tsx          // Market data display
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SchoolsGrid.tsx                // Top schools display
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AttractionsMap.tsx             // Local attractions
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CommuteTimesWidget.tsx         // Commute times display
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExperienceSection.tsx          // Our experience in area
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AvailablePropertiesGrid.tsx    // Property listings
```

```

**Total: 50 neighborhoods**

**3. Seed Data Script**

Create: `scripts/seed-neighborhoods.ts`

```typescript
// For each neighborhood, populate:
- name, slug, region, county
- description (2-3 paragraphs about the area)
- marketData (rent prices, vacancy, days on market, properties managed)
- topSchools (3-5 top-rated schools from GreatSchools.org)
- nearbyAttractions (5-10 local attractions)
- commuteTimes (estimate times to Midtown, Downtown, Airport, Perimeter)
- martaAccess (research MARTA availability)
- metaDescription (SEO-optimized 160 chars)
- featuredImage (upload neighborhood image or use stock)
```

**Data Sources for Seed:**
- Rent prices: Zillow, Rentometer, Apartments.com
- Schools: GreatSchools.org
- Attractions: Google Maps, local tourism sites
- Commute times: Google Maps estimates
- MARTA: MARTA.com route map

**4. Neighborhood Page Template Components**

Create reusable components:

```
src/components/neighborhoods/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NeighborhoodHero.tsx
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AboutNeighborhood.tsx          // Description richText display
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RentalMarketStats.tsx          // Market data with icons
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SchoolsGrid.tsx                // Top schools display

- Title: "[Neighborhood] Property Management | Allay"
- Description: `neighborhood.metaDescription`

- Need founder/team headshots
- Consider professional photo shoot

### Technical Complexity
- Interactive calculators on Pricing page are custom builds
- Google Maps integration requires API setup
- Multi-step form requires complex state management
- Video embeds need hosting setup

### SEO Priority
- Neighborhood pages are highest SEO value (40-50 pages targeting local keywords)
- Blog posts build domain authority over time
- Internal linking strategy critical

### Dependencies
- Google Maps API key
- Email service provider (Mailchimp, etc.)
- Video hosting (YouTube/Vimeo accounts)

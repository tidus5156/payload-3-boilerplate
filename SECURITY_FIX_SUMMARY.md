# Security Fix Summary

## Issue Found
Production database credentials were hardcoded in two files:
- `.mcp.json` - Contained PAYLOAD_SECRET
- `scripts/migrate-to-railway.ts` - Contained Railway production DATABASE_URI with password

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Credentials were never committed to Git (files were untracked)

## Actions Taken

### 1. Added `.mcp.json` to `.gitignore`
This prevents the MCP configuration file (which contains credentials) from being committed to version control.

### 2. Created `.mcp.json.example`
Template file showing the structure without real credentials. Users can copy this and add their own credentials.

### 3. Fixed `scripts/migrate-to-railway.ts`
Changed from hardcoded credentials to environment variables:
```bash
# New usage:
RAILWAY_DATABASE_URI="your-connection-string" pnpm tsx scripts/migrate-to-railway.ts
```

### 4. Verified No Leakage
Confirmed that production credentials were NOT committed to Git history and are NOT in any documentation files.

## Current Status
- ✅ `.mcp.json` is gitignored
- ✅ `.mcp.json.example` provides safe template
- ✅ Migration script uses environment variables
- ✅ No credentials in Git history
- ✅ `.env` already gitignored (stores actual credentials)

## Best Practices Going Forward

### Always Use Environment Variables
```bash
# Good - from .env file or environment
DATABASE_URI="${DATABASE_URI}"

# Bad - hardcoded
DATABASE_URI="postgresql://user:pass@host/db"
```

### For Scripts Requiring Credentials
Pass via environment variables:
```bash
DATABASE_URI="connection-string" pnpm tsx scripts/your-script.ts
```

### For Configuration Files
1. Create `.example` version with placeholders
2. Add real config file to `.gitignore`
3. Document in README how to set up

## Files to Never Commit
- `.env` ✅ (already gitignored)
- `.mcp.json` ✅ (now gitignored)
- Any file with actual passwords, API keys, or connection strings

## Where Credentials Should Live
✅ `.env` file (gitignored)
✅ Environment variables
✅ Secure credential managers (1Password, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

❌ Never in code files
❌ Never in configuration files committed to Git
❌ Never in documentation
